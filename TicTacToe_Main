void output_victories(int score[]);
// PURPOSE: Outputs the number of victories and ties for both players
//     INPUTS: score - a c-style array of length 3 containing the number of times each player has won as well as the number of ties
//     OUTPUTS: nothing; outputs to console


bool check_diagonal(vector<vector<string>> board, int col, int row);
// PURPOSE: Check using loops if there is a diagonal tic tac toe situation occuring
//     INPUTS: board - a 2D vector containing all the elements in the board as strings (numbers for empty spaces, X's, O's)
//             col - an integer value corresponding to the current column being checks
//             row - an integer value corresponding to the current row being checks
//     OUTPUTS: A boolean value; true if there is a tic tac toe diagonally otherwise false


bool check_vertical(vector<vector<string>> board, int col, int row);
// PURPOSE: Check recursively if there is a vertical tic tac toe situation occuring
//     INPUTS: board - a 2D vector containing all the elements in the board as strings (numbers for empty spaces, X's, O's)
//             col - an integer value corresponding to the current column being checks
//             row - an integer value corresponding to the current row being checks
//     OUTPUTS: A boolean value; true if there is a tic tac toe vertically otherwise false


bool check_horizontal(vector<vector<string>> board, int col, int row);
// PURPOSE: Check recursively if there is a horizontal tic tac toe situation occuring
//     INPUTS: board - a 2D vector containing all the elements in the board as strings (numbers for empty spaces, X's, O's)
//             col - an integer value corresponding to the current column being checks
//             row - an integer value corresponding to the current row being checks
//     OUTPUTS: A boolean value; true if there is a tic tac toe horizontally otherwise false


bool check_if_winner(vector<vector<string>> board);
// PURPOSE: Check if someone has won the game by doing vertical, horizontal, and diagonal board checks
//     INPUTS: board - a 2D vector containing all the elements in the board as strings (numbers for empty spaces, X's, O's)
//     OUTPUTS: A boolean value; true if there is a winner meaning a tic tac toe diagonally, vertically, or horizontally otherwise false


void update_board(vector<vector<string>>& board, char& current_player, char& other_player);
// PURPOSE: Asks the user to input a location, inserts an X or O based on the turn if that location exists or is not occupied, and then switches the turn
//     INPUTS: board - a 2D vector containing all the elements in the board as strings (numbers for empty spaces, X's, O's)
//            current_player - an X or O character corresponding to the user whose turn it is
//            other_player - an X or O character corresponding to the user whose turn is next
//     OUTPUTS: Nothing


void output_board(vector<vector<string>> board);
// PURPOSE: Outputs the board to console to show occupied and unoccupied positions
//     INPUTS: board - a 2D vector containing all the elements in the board as strings (numbers for empty spaces, X's, O's)
//     OUTPUTS: Nothing; output to console


bool check_if_play_again();
// PURPOSE: Checks if the user wants to play again
//     INPUTS: Nothing
//     OUTPUTS: A boolean value; true if the user enters 1 to repeat the game, false if the user enters 0 to quit the game
